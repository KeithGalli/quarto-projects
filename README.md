## Projects

### Generate Slideshow with Code (Airbnb Reviews Analysis)

In this project we have 6 months of Airbnb reviews data for the city of Boston. We leverage the RevealJS Quarto Presentation capabilities to generate slideshows with code. This highlights how a given neighborhood in Boston has performed recently. We also see how we can easily parameterize the analysis to look at different neighborhoods.

### Generate HTML Reports (Telecom Churn Analysis)

In this project we have a dataset of telecom customers and their churn status. We use Quarto to generate an HTML report that includes code, output, and narrative. This report is designed to be shared with a non-technical audience.

### Generate Dashboards with Quarto (Stock Price Analysis)

In this project we see how we can use Quarto to generate dashboards. We discuss the functionality to format your dashboards and show how you can include both Python & R code in the same document.

### Create Docs Website with Quarto

In this project we take a toy Python library (undocumented) and show how we can add docstrings and then use Quarto & Quartopub to create a documentation website for the library. We also walk through how we can deploy this to your own custom site
